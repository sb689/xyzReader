## Project Overview

This is an android application that mock RSS feed reader 
featuring banner photos and headlines. RSS feeds are fetched 
over the network. Users can read and share articles. 
The main objective of the project was to apply knowledge 
from material design. The project UI and elements should conform
to material design specifications. Meaningful motion, 
typography, surfaces, constraint layout, graphic design, 
adaptive design are the focal point of project development. This application
 was developed as part of
the Udacity Android nanodegree program. A starter code was provided.

## Why this Project

This project allows improving an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for 
building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task
 of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.
