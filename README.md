## Project Overview

This is an android application that mock RSS feed reader 
featuring banner photos and headlines. RSS feeds are fetched 
over the network. Users can read and share articles. 
The main objective of the project was to apply knowledge 
from material design. The project UI and elements should conform
to material design specifications. Meaningful motion, 
typography, surfaces, constraint layout, graphic design, 
adaptive design are the focal point of project development. This application
 was developed as part of
the Udacity Android nanodegree program. A starter code was provided.

## Why this Project

This project allows improving an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for 
building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task
 of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## Requirements

* App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity. 
* App theme extends from AppCompat.
* App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.
* App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).
* App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other
elements specified in the Material Design specification.
* App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml.
* App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
* App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary,
 and aren't otherwise distracting

## Learning objectives

* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to a mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.
